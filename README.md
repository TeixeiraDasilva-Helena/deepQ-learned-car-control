# Deep-Q Reinforcement Learning Car Control

This project demonstrates the use of **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to control a car in a simulated environment.  
A reinforcement learning agent is trained to navigate using discrete control actions and a reward signal.

Implemented as a **Jupyter notebook** for clarity, visualization, and experimentation.
